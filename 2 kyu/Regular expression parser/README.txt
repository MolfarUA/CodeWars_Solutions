Your task is to implement a simple regular expression parser. We will have a parser that outputs the following AST of a regular expression:

data RegExp = Normal Char       -- ^ A character that is not in "()*|."
            | Any               -- ^ Any character
            | ZeroOrMore RegExp -- ^ Zero or more occurances of the same regexp
            | Or RegExp RegExp  -- ^ A choice between 2 regexps
            | Str [RegExp]      -- ^ A sequence of regexps.

As with the usual regular expressions, Any is denoted by the '.' character, ZeroOrMore is denoted by a subsequent '*' and Or is denoted by '|'. Brackets, ( and ), are allowed to group a sequence of regular expressions into the Str object.

Or is not associative, so "a|(a|a)" and "(a|a)|a" are both valid regular expressions, whereas "a|a|a" is not.

Operator precedences from highest to lowest are: *, sequencing and |. Therefore the followings hold:

"ab*"     -> Str [Normal 'a', ZeroOrMore (Normal 'b')]
"(ab)*"   -> ZeroOrMore (Str [Normal 'a', Normal 'b'])
"ab|a"    -> Or (Str [Normal 'a',Normal 'b']) (Normal 'a')
"a(b|a)"  -> Str [Normal 'a',Or (Normal 'b') (Normal 'a')]
"a|b*"    -> Or (Normal 'a') (ZeroOrMore (Normal 'b'))
"(a|b)*"  -> ZeroOrMore (Or (Normal 'a') (Normal 'b'))

Some examples:

"a"          -> Normal 'a'
"ab"         -> Str [ Normal 'a', Normal 'b']
"a.*"        -> Str [ Normal 'a', ZeroOrMore Any ]
"(a.*)|(bb)" -> Or (Str [Normal a, ZeroOrMore Any]) (Str [Normal 'b', Normal 'b'])

The followings are invalid regexps and the parser should return Nothing in Haskell / 0 in C or C++ / null in JavaScript or C# / None in Python / new Void() in Java/Void() in Kotlin:

"", ")(", "*", "a(", "()", "a**", etc.

Feel free to use any parser combinator libraries available on codewars, or implement the parser "from scratch".
