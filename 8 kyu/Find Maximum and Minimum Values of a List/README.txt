Your task is to make two functions, max and min (maximum and minimum in PHP and Python, maxi and mini in Julia) that take a(n) array/vector of integers list as input and outputs, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that array/vector.

#Examples

maximun([4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]) returns 566
minimun([-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110]) returns -110
maximun([5]) returns 5
minimun([42, 54, 65, 87, 0]) returns 0

#Notes

You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.
