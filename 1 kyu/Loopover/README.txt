Everybody likes sliding puzzles! For this kata, we're going to be looking at a special type of sliding puzzle called Loopover. With Loopover, it is more like a flat rubik's cube than a sliding puzzle. Instead of having one open spot for pieces to slide into, the entire grid is filled with pieces that wrap back around when a row or column is slid.

Note: computer scientists start counting at zero!

Your task: return a List of moves that will transform the unsolved grid into the solved one. All values of the scrambled and unscrambled grids will be unique! Moves will be 2 character long Strings like the ones below.

For example, if we have the grid:

ABCDE
FGHIJ
KLMNO
PQRST
UVWXY
and we do R0 (move the 0th row right) then we get:

EABCD
FGHIJ
KLMNO
PQRST
UVWXY
Likewise, if we do L0 (move the 0th row left), we get:

ABCDE
FGHIJ
KLMNO
PQRST
UVWXY
if we do U2 (2nd column up):

ABHDE
FGMIJ
KLRNO
PQWST
UVCXY
and if we do D2 (2nd column down) we will once again return to the original grid. With all of this in mind, I'm going to make a Loopover with a scrambled grid, and your solve method will give me a List of moves I can do to get back to the solved grid I give you.

For example:

SCRAMBLED GRID:

DEABC
FGHIJ
KLMNO
PQRST
UVWXY
SOLVED GRID:

ABCDE
FGHIJ
KLMNO
PQRST
UVWXY
One possible solution would be ["L0", "L0"] as moving the top row left twice would result in the original, solved grid. Another would be ["R0", "R0", "R0"], etc. etc.

NOTE: The solved grid will not always look as nice as the one shown above, so make sure your solution can always get the mixed up grid to the "solved" grid!

Input
mixedUpBoard and solvedBoard are two-dimensional arrays (or lists of lists) of symbols representing the initial (unsolved) and final (solved) grids.

Different grid sizes are tested: from 2x2 to 9x9 grids (including rectangular grids like 4x5).

Output
Return a list of moves to transform the mixedUpBoard grid to the solvedBoard grid.

Some configurations cannot be solved. Return null (None in Python) for unsolvable configurations.

Good luck! Let me know if there are any issues with the kata! :)
