Description:

You are given a string containing 0's, 1's and one or more '?', where ? is a wildcard that can be 0 or 1.

Return an array containing all the possibilities you can reach substituing the ? for a value.
Examples

'101?' -> ['1010', '1011']

'1?1?' -> ['1010', '1110', '1011', '1111']

Notes:

    Don't worry about sorting the output.
    Your string will never be empty.
