You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop. Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

For example in the following picture the tail's size is 3 and the loop size is 12:

# Use the `next' attribute to get the following node
node.next

Note: do NOT mutate the nodes!

    Thanks to shadchnev, I broke all of the methods from the Hash class.
