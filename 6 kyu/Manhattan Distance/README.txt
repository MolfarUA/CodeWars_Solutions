The distance formula can be used to find the distance between two points. What if we were trying to walk from point A to point B, but there were buildings in the way? We would need some other formula..but which?

Manhattan Distance
Manhattan distance is the distance between two points in a grid (like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.

Complete the function that accepts two points and returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.

The points are arrays or tuples containing the x and y coordinate in the grid. You can think of x as the row in the grid, and y as the column.

Examples
manhattan_distance( [1, 1], [1, 1] ) # => returns 0
manhattan_distance( [5, 4], [3, 2] ) # => returns 4
manhattan_distance( [1, 1], [0, 3] ) # => returns 3
